Sometimes I create images, animations, etc. outside the world of academia. You can find some of my scripts and output at [my fun-data-science repo](https://github.com/kelseymalloy/fun-data-science.git)

## Weather Pattern Pie

This interactive image was created for a [Seasoned Chaos](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/) blog post. It shows all the timescales of the weather and climate system and the processes that go into forecasting the different scales. My clicking the static image, you can go to the 
HTML page with the interactive aspects. The interactive part allows you to click the timescales to focus on the particular processes; by hovering over the pie pieces, you can find a brief description. This image does not indicate any actual %s for each process nor is it an exhaustive list. Also, a process may belong to more than one parent timescale.
