description: Current openings in my lab.

I will likely have a paid internship opportunity for Univ. Delaware undergraduates for Summer 2026 related to weather/climate and wind energy. 

I will likely have an opening for 1 graduate student to join my research group for Fall 2026. The project/focus can be on any topic that fits the scope of my lab, though ideally I'm looking for someone who is interested in climate and severe convective storms. Check back Aug/Sept 2025 for more information.

Please contact me at kmmalloy at udel dot edu for more information or if interested.
