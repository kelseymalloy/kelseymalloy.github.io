#### Kelsey Malloy, Ph.D.

I am an Assistant Professor of Climatology in the Department of Geography and Spatial Sciences at the University of Delaware. My research focuses broadly on climate variability and dynamics, extratropical-tropical interactions, weather and climate extremes, climate risk, and predictability. Recently, I have been exploring the influence of climate on severe convective storm risk and understanding subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability through teleconnections. I am also involved in a science communication project for general audiences (see [Seasoned Chaos](http://seasonedchaos.github.io){:target="\_blank"}).
