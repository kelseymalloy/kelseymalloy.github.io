#### Kelsey Malloy, Ph.D.

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University who is studying monthly, El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-modulated North American severe convective storm risk as well as how climate change may be impacting that risk. Previously, I studied the predictability of U.S. Great Plains summer hydroclimate, primarily by understanding monsoon-forced teleconnections. I am interested in climate variability and dynamics, extratropical-tropical interactions, weather and climate extremes, and predictability. I am also involved in a science communication project for general audiences (see [Seasoned Chaos](http://seasonedchaos.github.io){:target="\_blank"}), K-12 outreach for science, and general data science/programming topics.
