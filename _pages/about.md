#### Malloy Climate Research Group

Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Spatial Sciences at the University of Delaware. My group's research focuses broadly on predictable climate variability and its applications. This includes climate dynamics, extratropical-tropical interactions, weather and climate extremes, climate risk, and subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability and prediction.
