I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University who is studying monthly, ENSO-modulated North American severe convective storm risk as well as how  climate change may be impacting that risk. I am interested in climate variability and dynamics, extratropical-tropical interactions, weather and climate extremes, and predictability. I am also involved in a science communication project for general audiences (see [Seasoned Chaos](http://seasonedchaos.github.io){:target="\_blank"}), K-12 outreach for science, and general data science/programming topics.
