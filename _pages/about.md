3rd-year Ph.D. Student studying subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability of U.S. summer hydroclimate through understanding large-scale forcing of the Great Plains low-level jet. I am interested in climate variability and dynamics, extratropical-tropical interactions, and predictability. I am also involved with a science communication project for general audiences (see [Seasoned Chaos](http://seasonedchaos.github.io){:target="\_blank"}, K-12 outreach for science, & general data science & programming topics.

You can explore my webpage using the header at the top of the page. It contains current projects & my resume. My professional social media accounts, email, & blogs can be found below. Enjoy!
