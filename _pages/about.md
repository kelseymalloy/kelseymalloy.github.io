I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate studying subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) predictability of U.S. summer hydroclimate through understanding extratropical teleconnections and large-scale influences of the Great Plains low-level jet. My advisor is [Ben Kirtman](https://benkirtman.weebly.com/){:target="\_blank"}, and our lab group mainly works on prediction and predictability between weather and climate (generally, S2S) timescales. I am interested in climate variability and dynamics, extratropical-tropical interactions, weather and climate extremes, and predictability. I am also involved in a science communication project for general audiences (see [Seasoned Chaos](http://seasonedchaos.github.io){:target="\_blank"}), K-12 outreach for science, and general data science/programming topics.
