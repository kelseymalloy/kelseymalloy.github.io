Sometimes I create images, animations, etc. related or not related to weather and climate. You can find some of my scripts and output at [my fun-data-science repo](https://github.com/kelseymalloy/fun-data-science.git)

# Seasoned Chaos

Most of my science communication work is done through [Seasoned Chaos](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/The-More-We-Learn-the-Less-We-Know-An-Introduction-to-Chaos/) blog posts. My [writer bio page](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/people/kelsey-malloy/) lists all the posts I have (co-)written. We also keep a [Github repository](https://github.com/seasonedchaos/seasonedchaos_codes) with some of the scripts used to create some of the figures/animations, which I have contributed to extensively.

## Lorenz Butterfly

This animation shows that the tiniest pertubations in initial conditions can result in such different outcomes. Learn more about this phenomena in this [Seasoned Chaos blog post](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/The-More-We-Learn-the-Less-We-Know-An-Introduction-to-Chaos/).

## Large-scale Setup for Severe Storms

While severe convective storms are largely triggered and described by small-scale/mesoscale processes, the large-scale environment can still influence the likelihood of severe convective storm conditions. Here is an example of favorable synoptic-scale conditions and how that may describe the pattern of springtime likelihood of tornado/hail/wind events across U.S. Learn more about how severe covective storms may be influenced by climate in this [Seasoned Chaos blog post](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/The-Yellow-Brick-Road-to-Predicting-Severe-Storms/).

## North Atlantic Oscillation: An Example of the Importance of <i>Timescale</i>

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is an important climate pattern since it describes a large part of temperature and precipitation variability for eastern North America and Europe. It exhibits variability on various timescales, so its influence really depends on the timescale of interest. This is demonstrated below by calculating the monthly, seasonal, annual, and decadal NAO index, which can mean different signs (phases) depending on which timescale you're interested in. Learn more about NAO in this [Seasoned Chaos blog post](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/Seasoned-Chaos-presents-the-North-Atlantic-Oscillation/).

## El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)

ENSO develops in the tropical Pacific and can be characterized by a feedback loop between the sea surface temperatures, surface winds, and thermocline. By clicking on an element of the loop, you should get a new image that shows thermocline, SST, or wind conditions during each of the phases of ENSO (warm El Niño, cool La Niña, or neutral). Learn more about ENSO in this [Seasoned Chaos blog post](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/Round-1-ENSO-is-King/).

## Weather Pattern Pie: Visualization of the Timescales of Climate System

This interactive image was created for this [Seasoned Chaos blog post](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/What-Can-the-Tropics-Tell-Us-About-Next-Weeks-Weather/). It shows all the timescales of the weather and climate system and the processes that go into forecasting the different scales. The interactive part allows you to click the timescales to focus on the particular processes; by hovering over the pie pieces, you can find a brief description. This image does not indicate any actual percentages of variability for each process nor is it an exhaustive list. Also, a process may belong to more than one parent timescale (e.g. ENSO can be seasonal or year-to-year).
