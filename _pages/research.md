Teleconnections describe links between large-scale fluctuations within the climate system and remote surface impacts. The overarching goal of my research is to understand <b>predictable</b> climate variability via <b>teleconnections</b>, bridging topics like:
- dynamical mechanisms in climate
- subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) predictability and prediction
- climate risk assessment for high-impact extremes
<h3></h3>
Our understanding of teleconnections, is incomplete, and it is unclear how teleconnections and their associated surface impacts might respond in a warming climate. I'm interested in developing a comprehensive view on climate processes, links, and impacts with a variety of approaches:
- hierarchal modeling frameworks
- statistical models
- data-driven models
