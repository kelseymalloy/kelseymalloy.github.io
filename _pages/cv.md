### Research Experience
#### Graduate Research Assistant, Univ. Miami Rosenstiel School 
<i>Fall 2017-Present</i>
+ Predictability of summer Great Plains / North American low-level jet and associated precipitation on S2S and interannual timescales through understanding of large-scale dynamics and climate variability
+ Using Python for reading and visualizing data
+ High-level data analysis on:
  -	NASA, ECMWF, and NOAA reanalysis and observational datasets (ERA-5, MERRA-2, ERSST, NCEP/NCAR, etc.)
  -	Community Climate System Model, v4 (CCSM4) forecast output
  -	Dry nonlinear baroclinic atmospheric model output
  -	Community Atmospheric Model, v5 (CAM5) output
+ Community Earth System Model (CESM1.2) and CAM5 setup, build, & run four different experiment
+ Setup, write code for monsoon forcing, and run idealized forcing with a dry nonlinear baroclinic model 
+ Oral presentation at 2021 AMS annual meeting
+ Oral presentation at Rosenstiel School Student Seminar series in 2019, 2020
+ Poster presentation at 2020 AMS annual meeting

#### Intern, NOAA Climate and Weather Prediction Center, Ocean Prediction Center
